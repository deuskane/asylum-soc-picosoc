This repository incluses the top level of minimal SoC :
- SoC User composed of :
  - 3 controllers GPIO (1 for switch and two for LEDs)
  - 1 UART
  - 1 SPI Master
  - 1 MCU based on Xilinx Picoblaze include the ROM instructions and dedication RAM
  - 1 GIC to manages all interrupts for MCU
  - 1 ICN to connect all slaves with MCU
  - SoC User includes safety features : Lock-Step or TMR.
- SoC Supervisor composed of :
  - 2 controllers GPIO (1 to reset the SoC User, 1 for LEDs)
  - 1 GIC to manages receive errors from SoC User
    - When an error is detected, the SoC Supervisor reset the SoC User.
  - 1 ICN to connect all slaves with MCU
